This post is long overdue, It's a compilation of topics over my final semester at YorkU. I also updated my projects page with the Unmanned Marine Vehicle I was working on over the past eight months for the final engineering capstone course. So, be sure to check that out!

# Residence Advisor aka Residence 'Don' Position at YorkU Vanier Residence

I'll never forget the first day I moved into Bethune Residence at York University. The excitement of moving away from home and starting a new chapter in life was unforgettable. I remember my first orientation with my floor-mates and my Don's first question being:

"Does anyone know what a Don is or does?"

I blurted out, "Aren't they apart of the Mafia or something?" All my peers got a good laugh from that but, that's how most people respond when I tell them I was a Residence 'Don'.

It started out feeling like I was a babysitter/police officer for young adults that were wilding out now that they had tremendous amounts of freedom. Later on though, as everyone matures (and gets grades back), they quickly realize that they're are at university for an education which means much more than living weekend to weekend partying. This is when I was able to use my skills to reach out to those individuals that were in distress and panic thinking about their future. I actually had to respond to quite a few medical, emotional, and community issues. To be honest, I didn't have many practical social-work related skills because my experience was mostly in technical in nature with some being managerial so this job was pretty challenging. Many students looked up to me because it seemed I had my life very well put together and we developed a strong bond and relationship. Also, my team of Dons were great at supporting me through this transition. I actually got the opportunity to meet with my direct supervisor and team weekly, which in my past job experiences doesn't happen as frequently. I also received feedback from students each semester. This one was a great read and is a testament to the impact I made on the residence life:

__*"In the short time that I have gotten a chance to know Keith, I feel as though I have been given a mentor who is always there to talk to about school, social life, anxiety, or just casual conversations. I can't speak for others, but I can't think of anyone who might possibly feel as though Keith has not been putting in an effort to make the change from home life to residence life as smooth as possible. I feel comfortable in Keith's presence and he makes me feel very welcome into the residence community." - All submissions were anonymous*__

My experience as Residence Don of Leadership and Learning Opportunities had me building the residence community with different extracurricular with the affiliated college (Vanier), faculty, and program affiliates. I educated students on life in school (clubs, organizations, etc) as well as extracurriculars (jobs, on planning their future). I also lead the Vanier Residence Council, which had over forty (40) active members (more than any of the other eight residence buildings). We planned fun events like laser tag, downtown adventures, as well as fundraisers for charities like [Keep Toronto Warm](https://www.keeptorontowell.com/). These were great events especially for international students.

# Conferences

I went to a couple conferences over my final year as well.

## Conference on Diversity in Engineering (CDE) 2017

The CDE educated delegates on the variety of individuals, cultures and perspectives found within engineering communities. CDE showed me another side of engineering which aimed to instill a notion of positivity and togetherness in creating spaces that value the differences between groups of engineering students and professionals.

I was selected as one of three students to participate from York University. The conference focused on idea-sharing and collaboration to allow for a deep-dive into conversations surrounding diverse backgrounds, education, and work. CDE was a great experience as I met students from other universities across Canada. I found it interesting how other schools incorporate engineering drinking culture into their schools. It's interesting because it's very important to some students, I mean that's what some people expect from the university experience. Although, with first years typically being under 19 (legal drinking age in Ontario) and others opposed to drinking because of religious or personal reasons, it really hinders the ability to bring people together. Despite that, I found many other ways/events that can bring people together that are more inclusive i.e. skating and adventures to new places like Niagara Falls (both of which I incorporated for residents at Vanier).

## Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute (CASI) Annual Dinner Meeting (ADM)

My good friend Mohammed Kagalwala won an award for being the top student at YorkU in space engineering and he invited me to the dinner which was nice of him. We met many industry professionals, professors, other students and award winners.

## CSDC FDR

The final design review is in David Florida Laboratory in Ottawa, Ontario. Our team is finishing procurement and will be prepared with hardware to test at FDR for the first time, hoping to stay within top 4 in this gate review.
