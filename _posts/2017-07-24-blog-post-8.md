# Where am I at now?
 This summer I got UAV Ground School training by [Aerobotika Aerial Inc.](https://aerobotika.com/) through York University and my [research lab group](http://costas-armenakis.lab.yorku.ca/).

Having prior experience with UAV mapping enabled me to excel in the program which was both theoretical and practical. We had in-class lectures and we performed indoor flight training with microdrones, the DJI Phantom 3, and tested our labs UAV that I've been working on this summer (2017).

 I solidified my knowledge of UAS Operations and (Canadian) Regulations, flight theory, Pilot decision making and human factors that effect flight performance, Advanced Meteorology principles for flying, Weather Services, Flight Planning, and Air Regulations.

 The certificate in this training program is required for UAV operations because of Transport Canada's requirements TP 15263E (08/2014) __Knowledge Requirements for Pilots of Unmanned Air Vehicle Systems UAV 25 Kg or less, Operating within Visual Line of Sight__.
