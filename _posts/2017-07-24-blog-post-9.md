# Back with another update from the CSDC YorkU team

 Last September (2017) I travelled to Vancouver, British Columbia to compete in the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the YorkU CSDC team with my good friend Ekram Bhuiyan. The CDR presentations were hosted at the head office of [UrtheCast](https://www.urthecast.com/) in beautiful downtown Vancouver. There was also a workshop held at [TRIUMF](http://www.triumf.ca/) near the University of British Columbia. TRIUMF is Canada's National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics. It has the **world's largest cyclotron**, which was used to simulate the impact radiation would have on the on-board electronics. We also got to tour of [MDA](https://mdacorporation.com/) in Richmond, BC and their Sapphire Satellite Operations Facility. The Sapphire satellite is Canada's first military satellite (launched in 2013) and it's dedicated to the Canadian Space Surveillance System. It's looking at active/inactive satellites, spent rocket bodies, and other space debris within 6,000 to 40,000 kilometers above Earth. The Sapphire satellite provides the data to the United States Space Surveillance Network which maintains a global catalog of these objects.

 The CDR presentation was a 2.5 hour comprehensive presentation that outlined the details of our satellite subsystem design (from power, attitude determination and control, communications, structure) and the project management side (from schedule, budget, risks, and educational outreach).

 The presentations were judged by a panel of experts from Canadian and U.S. space companies, the Canadian Space Agency, and the CSDC Management Society:
- Maarten Meerman, from Space Systems Loral (SSL - part of the newly-formed Maxar Corporation) in San Jose, California. Maarten has been a judge or workshop mentor in every previous CSDC offering.
- Adam Latour, from [Kepler Communications](http://www.keplercommunications.com/) in Toronto.
- Eric Gloutnay, from the [Canadian Space Agency](http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/). Eric is also a radiation effects expert, and assisted teams in the radiation testing workshop.
- Stefanos Derminakis, from UrtheCast in Vancouver, who was a member of the Concordia University team. This makes him the first CSDC alumnus to participate as a judge.
- Larry Reeves, also from UrtheCast, who is the CSDC Manager.

# How did we do though?!

**Our team took 4th place out of the thirteen (13) university teams,** we got the best marks out of all the teams in the structural and thermal subsystems and commended for the progress of our Attitude Determination and Control System.

Our task between now and the Final Design Review (May 2018) involves incorporating the judges' CDR suggestions. And then proceeding with the building, testing, and environmental qualification and verifications.

The Lassonde School of Engineering was established in 2013 and became the latest engineering school in Canada. I established our CubeSat team in 2014 and the main scientific objective of our CubeSat is to monitor greenhouse gases specifically methane for tracking emissions.

**Read more about the Challenge:** [www.csdcms.ca](www.csdcms.ca)
The Canadian Satellite Design Challenge (CSDC) is a Canada-wide challenge for teams of university students to design and build a 3U-CubeSat. Upon winning the challenge, there will be a launch to the International Space Station where the CubeSat will be deployed into orbit to conduct scientific research.
