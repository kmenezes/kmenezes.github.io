# Back with another update from the CSDC YorkU team

 Last September (2017) I travelled to Vancouver, British Columbia Canada to compete in the Critical Design Review (CDR) for the YorkU CSDC team with my good friend Ekram Bhuiyan. The CDR presentations were hosted at the head office of [UrtheCast](https://www.urthecast.com/) in beautiful downtown of Vancouver. There was also a workshop held at [TRIUMF](http://www.triumf.ca/) near the University of British Columbia. TRIUMF is Canada's National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics. It has the **world's largest cyclotron**, which was used to simulate the radiation environment of space to test robustness of electronics that we intend to use on our spacecraft. We also got to tour [MDA](https://mdacorporation.com/) in Vancouver and their Sapphire Satellite Operations facility.

 The CDR presentation was a 2.5 hour comprehensive presentation that outlined the details of our satellite subsystem design (from power, attitude determination and control, communications, structure) and the project management side (from schedule, budget, risks, and educational outreach).

 The presentations were judged by a panel of experts from Canadian and U.S. space companies, and the Canadian Space Agency, and the CSDC Management Society:
- Maarten Meerman, from Space Systems Loral (SSL - part of the newly-formed Maxar Corporation) in San Jose, California. Maarten has been a judge or workshop mentor in every previous CSDC offering.
- Adam Latour, from Kepler Communications in Toronto.
- Eric Gloutnay, from the Canadian Space Agency. Eric is also a radiation effects expert, and assisted the teams in the radiation testing workshop.
- Stefanos Derminakis, from UrtheCast in Vancouver, who was a member of the Concordia University team. This makes him the first CSDC alumnus to participate as a judge.
- Larry Reeves, also from UrtheCast, who is the CSDC Manager.

# How did we do though?!

**Our team took 4th place out of the thirteen (13) teams,** we also got the best marks out of all the teams in the structural and thermal subsystems!

Our job between now and the Final Design Review (May 2018) involves incorporating the judges' CDR suggestions. And then proceeding with the build, testing, and environmental qualification verifications.

The Lassonde School of Engineering established in 2013 and became the latest engineering school in Canada. The main scientific objective of our mission is to monitor greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

The Canadian Satellite Design Challenge (CSDC) is a Canada-wide challenge for teams of university students to design and build a nanosatellite. Upon winning the challenge there will be a launch to the International Space Station where the nanosatellite will be deployed into orbit to conduct scientific research.
