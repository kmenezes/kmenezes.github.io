# Background
On May 1st to May 4th I went on an overnight field trip for my Space Hardware class. The purpose was to demonstrate a complete software project using C and practice debugging using eclipse tools and AGI’s Systems Tool Kit (STK). I was able to apply the skills I’ve learned in the course based on RF equipment like spectrum analyzers, orbital mechanics, and RF transmission to perform antenna dish measurements and learn more about the receiving equipment at the Algonquin Radio Observatory (ARO). The ARO is Canada’s largest radio telescope which we used to take measurements of the largest celestial source in the sky.

##### More on the ARO

      Completed and commissioned in the 1965, ARO’s 46m antenna is the largest antenna in Canada and one of the largest in North America. The ARO is situated on a 100 acre wild and breathtakingly beautiful
      site in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;time=&amp;date=&amp;ttype=&amp;q=N45+11.655+W78+07.974&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;om=1&amp;ll=45.955506,-78.06284&amp;spn=0.026673,0.042572&amp;z=14">North
        of Algonquin park on Lake Traverse, deep inside the
        park. I found it pretty hard to explain where it exactly is so below is a map.

# Reflection
I think the field trip to ARO was the most beneficial experience I’ve had throughout my Space Engineering education. I really think the activities we performed -- especially the satellite tracking was extremely practical and applicable to us and our education. I’m happy that our software program worked flawlessly as we prepared for months to accomplish this goal. We were able to distinguish the satellite’s signal and from which navigational constellation it was from. Its really gratifying to say that we’ve used the largest radio telescope in Canada and used it to track GNSS satellites. We proved our ability to develop software in C and debug using eclipse tools and STK. I learned a lot about RF electrical equipment like spectrum analyzers and oscilloscopes. I developed a further understanding of orbital mechanics and RF transmission through the ARO activities.

My suggestion for this project would be to switch to an object orientated programming (OOP) language, which would make the understanding of how the code will all come together be understood more thoroughly by the students with only OOP skills/knowledge and background. Our work around for the Look Angles for example, was to create a structure for them. Another suggestion would be to include a graphical user interface component to the code. The prerequisite would be to actually have the code working but I think having it presented in a nice clean way instead of having the user enter commands into eclipse’s console would be much better. For example, if someone could have a github page that automatically fetches the newest TLE from Celestrak and has a nice display of all the satellites in-view and plots their trajectories would be a step up. There are packages to help accomplish this goal which have various online support tools see Slide 4 of this link https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160007351.pdf. **I may try to work on something like this in my spare time.**

I realized a lot of students didn’t know how to use STK well enough couldn’t test their code properly. An improvement would be to include a list of online resources that can easily be used for checking orbital, time and position parameters. I’ve gathered a list here for Julian Date, ECF positions, and much more (http://www.keithmenezes.ca/posts/2017/03/blog-post-4/).
