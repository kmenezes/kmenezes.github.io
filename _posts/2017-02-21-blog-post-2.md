# Largest CSDC PDR Attendance in History!

## Overview
The Lassonde School of Engineering at York University hosted 60 representatives from 14 Canadian universities during reading week (Feb. 21st).  The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) workshop took place over two days where each team presented their preliminary design of their nanosatellite. There were also presentations on various aspects of spacecraft design and project management, and participants got to complete the Amateur Radio Operators exam. The workshop concluded with a tour of the facilities we have here at the Centre for Research in Earth and Space Science (CRESS) laboratory.

On the first day, the manager of the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge (CSDC) Lawrence Reeves, Systems Engineering Designer at Urthecast, gave a lecture on orbital mechanics.

**The universities across Canada are well represented in the CSDC. All of them have very interesting payloads that will conduct important science and technology missions on orbit. The following university teams are participating in the fourth iteration of the CSDC: University of Alberta, University of British Columbia, Carleton University, Concordia University, École Polytechnique de Montréal, McGill University, University of Manitoba, Queen’s University, Simon Fraser University, University of Toronto, University of Victoria, University of Waterloo, University of Windsor and of course York University.**

On the second day of the workshop, the attendees were welcomed to The Bergeron Centre for Engineering Excellence at the Lassonde School of Engineering. The attendees took the Amateur Radio exam with Ori Siegal the local accredited examiner. The certification is important because the amateur frequency bands are typically used for non-commercial satellite communications.

## Then there were two presentations by York University researchers.

**Then another by Assistant Lecturer of Space Engineering Dr. Franz Newland who presented on the Deorbiting Spacecraft using Electrodynamic Tether (Descent) mission which is a collaborative research project with Honeywell, Ryerson University, and Canadian Space Agency.**

The workshop was also attended by members of Microsat Systems Canada Ltd. Matt Cannata (York University Space Engineering Alumni) presented on Design Consideration for Spacecraft Missions and Ross Gillet on Project Management Engineering and Space Systems Engineering.

The workshop ended with a tour of the CRESS lab where our school has a clean room for the assembly and integration of our spacecraft, a thermal vacuum chamber for testing our satellite in space environment conditions, and vibration table for testing our satellite under launch conditions.

Overall, the teams were impressed with the facilities we have here at Lassonde and we will be utilizing them as our unique competitive advantage. The teams in the CSDC are now working more as a development community by providing advice and assistance on design considerations which has improved the learning experience of the challenge. Our team is working hard towards the next design review which will take place in September of this year.

I want to thank Lawrence Reeves for creating and managing the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge, Ross Gillet and Matt Cannata from Microsat Systems Canada Ltd., Kristen Cote, Franz Newland, and Hugh Chesser for their presentations, Amateur Radio Examiner Ori Siegal, and all the participants for coming out.

The Lassonde School of Engineering was established in 2013 and became the latest engineering school in Canada. I established our CubeSat team in 2014 and the main scientific objective of our CubeSat is to monitor greenhouse gases specifically methane for tracking emissions.

The Canadian Satellite Design Challenge (CSDC) is a Canada-wide challenge for teams of university students to design and build a 3U-CubeSat. Upon winning the challenge, there will be a launch to the International Space Station where the CubeSat will be deployed into orbit to conduct scientific research.
