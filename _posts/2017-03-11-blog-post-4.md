# Important websites for calculating satellite-positioning
Some tools I'm using for this project [ARO-Tracking-Software.](http://github.com/kmenezes/ARO-Tracking-Software)

## [Julian Date Calculator](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/JulianDate.php)
Julian dates (abbreviated JD) are simply a continuous count of days and fractions since noon Universal Time on January 1, 4713 BC (on the Julian calendar). Almost 2.5 million days have transpired since this date. Julian dates are widely used as time variables within astronomical software, which is what I'm using this for to determine the reference epoch of the satellite see my [ARO-Tracking-Software](http://github.com/kmenezes/ARO-Tracking-Software).

Typically, a 64-bit floating point (double precision) variable can represent an epoch expressed as a Julian date to about 1 millisecond precision. I really noted the run-time difference when I was incrementing using the regular date versus Julian Date about millisecond to couple seconds difference.

Note that the time scale that is the basis for Julian dates is Universal Time, and that 0h UT corresponds to a Julian date fraction of 0.5.

## [Satellite Look Angle Calculator](http://www.groundcontrol.com/Satellite_Look_Angle_Calculator.htm)
This tool helps find obstacles, such as trees and buildings, between a satellite dish installation location and an orbiting satellite.

You can type in ANY street or city address (globally), and the look angle calculator will zoom into an overhead aerial view of your installation location and draw a line showing the compass heading toward the satellite. It will also list the elevation angle (aka "look angle"), so you can locate a perfect installation location.

Its used for satellite television but helps for determining where to look for the satellite i.e. tracking it as well.

## [Latitude, Longitude, Height to/from ECEF (X,Y,Z)](http://www.oc.nps.edu/oc2902w/coord/llhxyz.htm)
This tool enables you to enter Longitude, Latitude, Height and convert it to Earth Centered, Earth Fixed (ECEF) x-y-z coordinates in kilometers.

Great for checking the math when performing the matrix transformation.

## [Online Satellite and Flare Tracking](http://www.satflare.com/track.asp#TOP)
With this page you can track in real time all the satellites orbiting the Earth, with both 2D and 3D interactive representations, predict their passes, view their trajectory among stars on an interactive sky chart, predict satellite flares and transits (across the Sun and the Moon), find out the best location to see these events on a detailed Google map. You can also follow satellite re-entries and other special events, join the observer community, post messages and share your comments and observations.

## [Satview.org Tracking Satellites](http://www.satview.org/)
Tracks the International Space Station (ISS) like the other website above but also tracks re-entry of orbital debris.

## [Heavens-Above](http://www.heavens-above.com/)
Very versatile webpage also comes with an app. It can calculate a lot with satellites and celestial objects. You can view constellations and much more.

## [Online Satellite Calculations](http://www.satellite-calculations.com/)
Collection of websites and other online tools. Check it out if the others don't have what you need.
