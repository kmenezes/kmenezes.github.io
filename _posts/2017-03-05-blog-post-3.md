# Importance of being Compliant with Transport Canada UAV Operations February 28th, 2017

Today I attended a public seminar held by the [Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society (AESS) IEEE Toronto](http://ieee-aess.org/) chapter.

The discussion was about addressing various regulations and operational aspects we need to be aware of for the safe and legal operation of small sized UAVs.

**The speaker was Dr. Costas Armenakis the Professor that has given me the research experiences I've had over the past two summers. He was able to give examples on the applications we made for the Wetland Mapping project and the Uav-g-2015 conference Special Flight Operations Certificates (SFOCs) that we had to write**

There was a mix of industry professionals from HydroOne and Cinematography markets and researchers from Ryerson University in the subjects of Civil and Electronics.

I learned that many of the companies are already using UAV technology and are still learning how to adapt this new technology into their workflows. It seems that the Transport Canada Regulations are they hurdle that they must overcome before they investigate the technological solutions and software programs that will provide the best results for clients.
