# Importance of being Compliant with Transport Canada UAV Operations February 28th, 2017

Today I attended a public seminar held by the [Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society (AESS) IEEE Toronto](http://ieee-aess.org/) chapter.

The discussion was about addressing various regulations and operational aspects we need to be aware of for the safe and legal operation of small sized UAVs.

The speaker was Dr. Costas Armenakis the Professor that has given me the research experiences I've had over the years.

There was a mix of industry professionals and researchers from Ryerson University in the subjects of Civil and Electronics.
