I'm currently enrolled in a course called Space Mission Design and Analysis. I have a group of 5 people (including myself) who are all very skilled in space engineering.

We hadto decide a topic on our space mission and the space-based solution that we use to solve user-needs and a problem.

Upon doing some research into satellite missions that interest me i learn about

I met the CEO of OneWeb at the SmallSat Symposium 2016 in 2015 Toronto,ON. I sat attentively during Greg Whilers presentation was was amazed. I also was sittingnear a representative from planet labs, who are designing another cubesat solution which will image every part of the earth .

 One thing i learned is that there are 3 billion people or more than half the people in the world that dont have access to internet or who are underserved by their current infrastructure and network.
