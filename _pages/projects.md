This is where I will be keeping up to date progress reports of my projects via photos and documents.

| Unmanned Systems | Space Exploration | Extracurricular |
|:--------:|:--------------:|:---------------:|
|Anything remotely controlled, semi-autonomous, to fully autonomous systems (multirotors, helicopters, planes, planetary rovers, boats and submarines).  |  CubeSat: mechanical and electrical design, antenna design, space-segment-software design/implementation/testing/deployment/maintenance, wireless communication, thermal/vibrational/vacuum testing and reliability. | Software Dev (web/apps, games), VR/AR, cloud geospatial analytics toolsâ€‹, big data, machine learning, GPS. |

### Drones

I am active in the DIY-UAS community on [DIYDRONES](http://diydrones.com/profile/menezes) and I'm always willing to provide advice/assistance as well as learn from others. I have practical experience in planning and executing aerial surveys (using UAV technology), acting as a navigator/pilot, writing approved Special Flight Operations Certificates, and developing UAV technology/platform solutions.

### CubeSats

I've also working on various nanosatellite (CubeSat) development projects at the Lassonde School of Engineering. The main one being the [Canadian Satellite Design Challenge Team at York University](https://www.lassat.ca). Our challenge is to design and build a 3U CubeSat from scratch using limited commercial off the shelf components by mostly designing it ourselves. The competition information [can be found here](https://www.csdcms.ca). I also played an important role in the team working towards the [QB-50 project](https://www.qb50.eu).
