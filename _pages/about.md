Hello, my name is Gabriel L. R. and I'm a M.A. in Astrophysics candidate at the [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS](http://www.if.ufrgs.br/posfis/index.php).

I have Bsc physics degree from the [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG](http://furg.br). Part time of my undergrad studies was performed at [State University of New York at Oswego - SUNY Oswego](http://www.oswego.edu/) thanks to the [Science Without Borders Program ](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/).

I have experience on computational astrophysics working with variable stars and methods to detect periodicities in the light curves of those type of stars. I wrote a algorithm to calculate periods of pulsation for [Cepheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cepheid_variable) and [RR Lyrae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RR_Lyrae) stars as part of my final project for my undergrad studies. I you have interest you can visit my [Github](https://github.com/glauffer) page or if you want a more robust algorithm you can check the [Plotypus](https://github.com/astroswego/plotypus) project, a python library for modelling and plotting light curves which I am a collaborator.
