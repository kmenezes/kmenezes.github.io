Hello, my name is Keith Menezes and I'm a B.Eng. in Space Engineering candidate at the [Lassonde School of Engineering, York University](http://www.lassonde.yorku.ca/).
{: .text-justify}

My main interests are in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Nano-Satellites. I have been very fortunate throughout my lifetime to be involved in fantastic experiences all over the world that have driven my passions and curiosities. These events have ultimately formed my education and career path.

Drones
========
I am active in the DIY-UAS community on [DIYDRONES](http://diydrones.com/profile/menezes) and I'm always willing to provide advice/assistance as well as learn from others. I have practical experience in planning and executing aerial surveys (using UAV technology), acting as a navigator/pilot, writing approved Special Flight Operations Certificates, and developing UAV technology/platform solutions.

CubeSats
==========
I've also working on various nanosatellite (CubeSat) development projects at the Lassonde School of Engineering. The main one being the [Canadian Satellite Design Challenge Team at York University](https://www.lassat.ca). Our challenge is to design and build a 3U CubeSat from scratch using limited commercial off the shelf components by mostly designing it ourselves. The competition information [can be found here](https://www.csdcms.ca).I also played an important role in the team working towards the [QB-50 project](https://www.qb50.eu).
