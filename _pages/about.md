My main interests are in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Nano-Satellites. I have been very fortunate throughout my lifetime to be involved in fantastic experiences all over the world that have driven my passions and curiosities. These events have ultimately formed my education and career path.

*Having a great time in the middle of no-where (i.e. Lake Claire, largest lake in Alberta), yes there were a lot of bugs, thus the face-net, making it easier to concentrate on navigating for my pilot.*
